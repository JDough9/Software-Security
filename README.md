Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    Artemis Financial is looking to upgrading the security of an existing appplication.
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Testing for vunerabilities, static testing was the most enjoyable. Its important to code securely because the data transpoted across systems can be highly sensitive and protecting customer and proprietary data is beneficial for a companies well being.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The dependency check was definitely the most helpful tool. The library of plug ins was vast and out dated and it was overwhelmingly challenging to approach.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Determining which dependencies are outdated and vunerable to attack. Suppressing false positives and determining the best cipher algorithm to deploy.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Consistently 
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Utilizing hash functions to deply encrypted communications would certainly be my strongest skill gained. I had a challenging time hashing these functions
